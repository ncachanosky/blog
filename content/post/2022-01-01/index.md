[Absher, Grier, and Grier (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167268120302237) find that durable left-leaning populist regimes in Latin America produce significant economic costs. However, there is an exception: Ecuador under [Rafael Correa's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Correa) presidency. [Edwards (2019)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.33.4.76) argues that left-leaning populist regimes monetize their spending. Ecuador would be a particular case because it has a dollarized economy. [Domingo Cavallo (2021)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093DZZ68N/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), for instance, says there is no doubt that dollarization played a central role in avoiding Ecuador becoming the Venezuela of Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro.

In this paper, co-authored with [Alex Salter](https://www.awsalter.com/) (Texas Tech University) and Ignacio Savanti (Universidad del CEMA), we study how dollarization constrained Rafael Correa's presidency (2007 and 2017).

**Abstract**
> Rafael Correa’s presidency in Ecuador (2007 – 2017) exemplifies left-leaning populist regimes in Latin America. However, there is a key difference: Ecuador is a dollarized economy. This removes the possibility of fiscal dominance over monetary policy as is common in populist regimes. This paper studies how dollarization constraints a populist leader. We discuss the incentives of a budget constraint immune to monetization and the failed attempt to launch a national digital currency.
