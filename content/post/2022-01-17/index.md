title: "The Gold Standard: Retropsect and Prospect"
subtitle: Fifty years after the Nixon shock, it is difficult for many to imagine a dollar connected to gold. Most Americans have never used a gold-backed dollar. They do not understand how the gold standard worked. They have not considered the merits of returning to the gold standard. The gold standard, in their minds, is a relic of a bygone era. The contributions in this volume help to bridge the knowledge gap created by fifty years of fiat money.

On August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon closed the gold window. On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of this event, AIER published an edited [book on the gold standard](https://www.aier.org/product/gold-standard/). The functioning of this monetary regime is one of those topics that are surrounded more by myths than reality. AIER's book brings a reality check to the historical performance of the gold standard. As the editors of the book [Peter C. Earle](https://www.aier.org/staffs/peter-c-earle/) and [William J. Luther](https://williamjluther.com/) say (emphasis added):Â 

> In general, the gold standard effectively managed the money supply to stabilize the purchasing power of money over time. **This was no accident**.

You can see in the table of contents below that the book is novel in including a discussion about cryptocurrencies. I'm very lucky to be included in a volume along with some of my favorite monetary economists. I hope you consider reading the book and consume some real-world analysis of the merits and shortcomings of the gold standard.
